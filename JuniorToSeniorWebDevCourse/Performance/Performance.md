## 3 Keys To Performance
Always generate benchmarks! And constantly compare to them with each improvement.

1. Improve the client side
2. Improve the transfer content/network latency
3. Improve backend

## Network Performance
- Compress/Shrink the files being transfered
  - Minimizing Text files (HTML, JS, CSS, etc)
  - Minimize Images (compressing or optimizing)
    - Remove image metadata 
  - Use media queries to dynamically load images
  - Compressing files
